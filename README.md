# Data Visualization and Analytics with R
In this repository, I implement my technical skill regarding R programming through data visualization and analytics processes. Most of data that will be employed are around Economics and Banking & Finance. In addition, the objective of this repository is to inform audience the current trend of economics and Bankinig & Finance. Most of visualizations are devised by either ggplot2 or plotly packages. I perform continuous update as possible as I can to this repository.
