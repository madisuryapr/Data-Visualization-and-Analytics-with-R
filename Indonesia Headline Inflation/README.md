![Indonesia Headline Inflation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f595d99e-785e-4a32-8dd6-08d4e2639ca2)

In this folder, I utilize Indonesia's headline inflation data obtained from Bank Indonesia over the period of January 2015 until May 2025, covering a decade of data. The inflation data are in year-over-year (yoy) growth from, in which compares Consumer Prices Index (CPI) from current period to the same period in previous year. Furtermore, I utilized ggplot2 to visualize time series chart. Several insights that can be conveyed from the visualiation are as follows:

- At the beginning of COVID-19 Pandemic, Indonesia experienced declining inflation trend, reaching its lowest point in August 2020 at 1.32% (yoy). This declining trend is attributed to lower household consumption due to mobility restriction policy in order to manage COVID-19 virus spread and tackle further surge of cases, hence slowing economic activity and social gatherings. Many policymakers suggest that low inflation rate indicates slow household consumption pattern within Indonesia perspective. Nevertheless, Indonesian government released diverse stimulus packages to resurrect and boost economic activity.

- Later, in 2022, Indonesia inflation trend began to escalate due to the emergence of Russian-Ukraine war that inflicts detrimental effect on global economy, indicated by surging commodity prices such as wheat and oil prices. This phenomenon generated spill-over effect on domestic economy through higher prices of commodity and inflation reached its peak at 5.95% (yoy) in September 2022. Surging inflation rate hencefort alerted Central Banks around the world in general to raise their policy rate and Indonesia is no exception to this decision in order to control inflation as well as mitigate further risks on the economy due to high prices.

- However, 2024 becomes the turning point for Indonesia's headline inflation where another declining trend began. In 2024, Indonesia experienced deflation for 5 months consecutively for its month-to-month (mtm) inflation. Several analysts consider that this phenomenon is attributed to lower household consumption in consequence of slowing domestic demand for goods and services. The culmination of declining inflation trend can be seen in February 2025, where Indonesia for the first time since 25 years ago reached its deflation point for year-over-year inflation, positioning at -0.09% (yoy).
