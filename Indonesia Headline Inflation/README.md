In this folder, I utilize Indonesia's headline inflation data obtained from Bank Indonesia over the period of January 2015 until May 2025, covering a decade of data. The inflation data are in year-over-year (yoy) growth from, in which compares Consumer Prices Index (CPI) from current period to the same period in previous year. Furtermore, I utilized ggplot2 to visualize time series chart. Several insights that can be conveyed from the visualiation are as follows:

- According to Indonesia Investment (2020), At the beginning of COVID-19 Pandemic, Indonesia experienced declining inflation trend, reaching its lowest point on August 2020 at 1.32% (yoy). This declining trend is attributed to lower household consumption due to mobility restriction policy in order to manage COVID-19 virus spread and tackle further surge of cases, hence slowing economic activity.
