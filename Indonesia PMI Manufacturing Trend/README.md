In this repository, I demonstrate how to visualize Indonesia PMI Manufacturing dataset, covering last 2 years of data. The threshold of PMI Manufacturing based on S&P Global is 50.
Higher value than 50 indicates contry manufacturing sector is in expansion phase, whereas value less than 50 indicates contraction phase.
