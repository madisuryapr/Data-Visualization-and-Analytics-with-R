Around April and May 2025, some Indonesian banks released their Q1 financial statements, in which containn diverse information regarding Banks' operational, encompassing Assets and Liabilities, Income Statements, as well as Key Ratios Performance (e.g. Non-Performing Loan (NPL) Ratio and Cost-to-Income Ratio). In Q1-2025, there are three banks that become Indonesian banks with the largest total assets, namely Bank Mandiri (BMRI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI), and Bank Central Asia (BBCA) where they recorded total assets respectively, Rp2,464, Rp2,098, and Rp1,534 Trillion.
