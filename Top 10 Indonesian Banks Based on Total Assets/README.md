In this repository, I visualized Top 10 Indonesian Banks based on their total assets as of Q1-2025. I obtained the data from Indonesia news channel namely CNBC Indonesia. Please kindly refer to this news for detailed information regarding all data I utilized: [CNBC Indonesia news about Banks Total Assets](https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/market/20250523164013-17-635768/10-bank-terbesar-di-ri-2025-ada-yang-asetnya-lompat-161)  

Around April and May 2025, some Indonesian banks released their Q1 financial statements, in which contain diverse information regarding Banks' operational, encompassing Assets and Liabilities, Income Statements, as well as Key Ratios Performance (e.g. Non-Performing Loan (NPL) Ratio and Cost-to-Income Ratio). In Q1-2025, there are three banks that become Indonesian banks with the largest total assets, namely Bank Mandiri (BMRI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI), and Bank Central Asia (BBCA) where they recorded total assets respectively, Rp2,464, Rp2,098, and Rp1,534 Trillion.  

- Bank Mandiri (BMRI) Total Assets based on Consolidate Financial Statements as of March 31st, 2025 is Rp2,464 Trillion. Higher BMRI Total Assets compared to the same period previous year is attributed to increasing amount of values in some components, including cash, government bonds to related parties, and Net Loans and Sharia Receivables/financing. BMRI Cash as of Q1-2025 is Rp35.498 Trillion or 12.1% growth compared to Q4-2024 Financial Statements. Government bonds to related parties is also increasing to Rp290.69 Trillion, growing 1.2% (qtq).

- Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) Total Assets based on Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31st, 2025 is recorded at Rp2,098 Trillion. Increasing of BBRI's Total Assets is attributed to higher value in several components, namely Cash, current accounts with Other Banks, and Placement with Bank Indonesia and Other Financial Institutions.
