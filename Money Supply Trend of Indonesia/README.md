This folder represents my work pertaining to visualizing Indonesia money supply data over the period of January 2020 until June 2025,
encapsulating both during- and post-pandemic period.
Money Supply (MS) within Indonesian perspective consists of two main components, namely Narrow Money Supply (M1) and Broad Money Supply (M2).

Both M1 and M2 are visualized in Nominal value (Billion IDR) and year-over-year (yoy) growth terms. In general, since the eruption of COVID-19 in Indonesia, both M1 and M2 experiences upward trajectory due to increasing value of all constructing components of money supply.
